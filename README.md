README: 
Cassandra Flur PROJECT PULSE

Information in config/db may need to be updated for user ( ei. address. )

*To get the database working you will need to navigate to Projekt/sql and run the reset.sql file. 

*Once the database is reset, go to the projekt/route and use node to run reset.js. This will make it so all made users in the database now has a encrypted password - without it you cannot login. 

Now you have everything you need, so navigate back to /projekt and simply type the command 
node index.js, and open http://localhost:1337/pulse/login in your browser. 

Thank you!
